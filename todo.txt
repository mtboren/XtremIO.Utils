todo:
-enable adding/removing volume to/from ConsistencyGroup (via Set-XIOConsistencyGroup, or via Add-XIOVolumeToConsistencyGroup, Remove-XIOVolumeFromConsistencyGroup?)
- eventually support filtering in -URI param _and_ returning XioItemInfo.* objects (filtering in URI and using -ReturnFullResponse works as expected), need to have new code that either:
	- with &full=1 in URI:  needs to do something to handle return-obj creation from "&full=1" object; near the "_New-ObjectFromApiObject" call in Get-XIOItemInfo
	- without &full=1 in URI:  needs to do additional call to Get-XIOItemInfo of just the URL (for each URL) from the <item-type> property of object returned from filtered call, and does not do the rest of the Get-XIOItemInfo call that was in the works when the original call w/ the URI with filter was passed; needs to consider (and preserve / pass-on) the "prop=..." bits from original URI, if any
- after Filter support is in place:
	- add -Filter param to the Get-XIO* cmdlets for which it makes sense
	- for Get-XIOSnapshot:  add Param option for "ancestor-vol-id", implement via Filter -- available via xmcli
	- for Get-XIOVolume:  add Param option for "sg-id" (snapshot group ID), implement via Filter -- available via xmcli
	- potentially once API allows for things like "?folder-id=b38b38123b38123asdfb38b38123" in the query string, can use IDs in URI?  Until then, these IDs would only be used to filter items _after_ they've been retrieved from the XMS appliance
	- once assuming that min XIO REST API version is 2.0 (after dropping support for XMS older than v4) improve Get-XIOLunMap:
		- change the -Volume, -HostLunId, and -InitiatorGroup params to use -Filter on Get-XIOItemInfo (do away with -Volume and -InitiatorGroup, since those are handled via -RelatedObject?)
- improve `Set-XIOLdapConfig`:
	- add ability to append a role mapping (instead of user having to specify full RoleMapping value for every Set operation)
-expand availability of -Property parameter on other Get-* cmdlets as it makes sense (already done on Get-XIOLunMap)
	-include "translation" config item to go from "nice" property names (as returned on XIOItemInfo.* objects) to API Objects' property names, so that consumer does not need to know the API property names
	-will need to update type definitions and the hsh table definitions for the eventual New-Object call to expect/handle/allow $null values, so as to be able to populate only some property values for the return object, as done for Volume/Snapshot, LunMap objects
-once .Cluster type of property is added to cluster-specific objects:
	-for Volume: update New-XIOSnapshot to take cluster value from Volume object when Volume object taken from pipeline (and if that particular Volume has a Cluster property value)
	-this is also in prep for better pipelining, which will need to get Cluster info from pipeline object coming through (along with .ComputerName, right?)
	-once added to Volume and Tag, update New-XIOConsistencyGroup to take it from Volume/Tag objects if those were passed as values to -Volume or -Tag?  Else, user has to specify the vol/tag _and_ the cluster, when that should be gleanable from the vol/tag objects themselves (right?)
-change the .Guid property on API v1 objects to have value that, if .guid property of API obj does not exist, then use <objType>-id[0] (the Id part of the <id>,<name>,<index> array)
	-then, can more universally use that Guid in pipelining and whatnot
-fix bug in New-XIOVolume:  when specifying both -ParentFolder and -Cluster, throws error:  "message": "Command Syntax Error: Invalid property parent-folder-id"
	-either send ParentFolder property as part of tag_list value (need to test), or do not include -ParentFolder in same paramset as -Cluster?
-fix bug in Get-XIOSnapshotScheduler when using by URI:  must have "?cluster-name=<blahh>" in the URI, or request returns error:  "message": "cluster_id_is_required"
	-encountered when connected to multi-cluster XMS and creating new SnapshotScheduler
-once pipelining supports getting SnapshotScheduler by Volume/Snapshot, add bit to Remove-XIOVolume that checks first if Volume/Snapshot is part of a SnapshotScheduler, throwing an error if so (instead of the current behavior that does not check and that results in an error from the API call, "cannot_remove_volume_that_has_a_scheduler")
-investigate adding New-XIOLdapConfig (the POST how-to is not specified in the API reference -- present but not documented? -- if not, add cmdlet once (if ever) this method is supported for this object type)
	-same for adding Remove-XIOLdapConfig (the DELETE how-to is not specified in the API reference)
-replace "manual" enumeration of valid types for param values in Get-XIOEvent with legit Enums
	-do same for Get-XIOItemInfo?
-improve New-XIOLunMap:
	-take initiatorgroup from pipeline (by property of InitGrpId); currently expects IG _name_, and doesn't accept by pipeline (weak)
	-update -Volume to accept vol objects or vol name (just does name right now), and take Volume obj from pipeline
-update Parent* properties of older objects to be obj like: <parentType>Id, Name, Index as returned by helper function
-include support for Get-XIOSnapshotScheduler to get by Volume/snapshot/snapset (and, accept from pipeline, too) as related object
-for when removing InitiatorGrpIdList from IgFolder object (deprecated after v0.11), remove the three spots that take it from pipeline via:  ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName=$true)][Alias("InitiatorGrpIdList")]
-add pipelining abilities for things like (add their tests at the same time!):
	Get-XIOTag | Get-XIO<any of the six object types -- Volume, ConsistecyGroup, SnapshotSet, InitiatorGroup, Initiator, SnapshotScheduler
	Get-XIOInitiatorGroup | Get-XIOLunMap (just by IG name until adding support for "by IGrpID" when working on XIOSv4 things)
	Get-XIO[Volume|Snapshot] | Get-XIOLunMap (just by Volume name until adding support for "by IGrpID" when working on XIOSv4 things)
		-on Volume object, LunMappingList property is currently array of three items (two arrays and an int), like:  @(<initiator group ID string>, <initiator group name>, <initiator group object index number>), @(<target group ID>, <target group name>, <target group object index number>), <host LUN ID>
		-need to break this apart, have MappingIdList property or so, and be able to get XIOLunMap via MappingId, or the LunMapList that has LunMap <id,name,index> objects instead of list of arrays of strings
	## currently behaves unexpectedly when using something like:

-check into / remove use of deprecated properties, if any, from list: (per v3.0.1 REST API guide, p12)
	-In version 3.0, the following object parameters are not in use and have been deprecated:
		-Cluster object:
			-max-snapshots-per-volume
			-meta-data-utilization-level
			-meta-data-utilization
			-vamd-memory
			-vamd-memory-in-use
			-max-cgs-per-volume
			-max-cgs
			-num-of-r-mdls
			-max-snapsets-per-cg
			-max-vol-per-cg
			-num-of-d-mdls
			-min-num-of-ssds-per-healthy-rg
			-num-of-c-mdls
		-Storage Controller object:
			-eth-link-health-level
	-In version 3.0.1, the following object parameters are not in use and have been deprecated:
		-Storage Controller object:
			-hw-revision
	-also, others listed on p198 of v3.0.1 REST API guide
-change wording around Disable-CertValidation to refer to the output as ServerCertificateValidationCallback, not CertificatePolicy
-address performance properties that are no longer "real" from the API, but still presented as properties/values on objects; for example:  IgFolder objects have an IOPS property that may actually have no value, but that gets cast to an Int in the SupportingFunctions, and becomes "0" for the returned object
	-need to make these nullable? (can we?)
-try Invoke-WebRequest in place of the WebClient .NET class (this guy reports success vs. Invoke-RestMethod when same symptoms, but uses an IDontCare CertPolicy:  https://communities.vmware.com/thread/466166)
-add Update-Snapshot to correspond to "refresh" operation in mgmt GUI
	-Create a Snapshot and reassign on a Volume, Consistency Group or Snapshot Set (see Table 4, on page 192).
		Note: Refer to example use cases for taking Snapshots and reassigning on a Volume, Consistency Group or Snapshot Set, on page 14.
-for New-Snapshot, add support for XIOSv3 (APIv1) snapshots; currently only supports new snapshots on XIOSv4 (APIv2)
	-for XIOS v3.0, support creation:
		-from one volume
		-from volumes
		-from one volumefolder
-XIOS v4 properties/types to add/update/handle:
	-on XMS object, provide DateTime property from the ISO8601 date/time string that has timezone abbreviation in it
	not doing yet:
		-consistency-group-volumes, as their properties returned seem to just be consistency groups, not consistency group volumes (properties match identically, and there are none of the Performance types of properties in the object as there are in the advertised object per the API guide)
			-and, from initial query of "https://xms.dom.com/api/json/types/consistency-group-volumes", the sub-property is "consistency-groups" (instead of the expected "consistency-group-volumes")
			-possible mix-up in the API?
		-getting performance counter for Tag EntityType needs more work (API call needs obj-list defined, apparently, and is throwing errors even when having done so)
-future release:  remove deprecated properties that are noted by System.ObsoleteAttribute statements (deprecated in v0.9.5 or so)
	-before then, compile the type definition, so that these properties actually write warning in PowerShell session to make it more clear to users that properties are deprecated? Else, relying on them to have thoroughly read the changelog
-for supporting targeted cluster queries on XMS appliances that manage multiple clusters, still need to:
	-add piece that checks that the given Cluster values are managed by this XMS and if not, doesn't even try to get the given object, just does write-verbose of "no such cluster managed by this XMS", instead of non-graceful throw of, ""message": "sys_not_found""
	-?add piece that, if .Cluster count on given XIOConnection is 1, does not try to use cluster-name input param in URI
-for Get-XIO*Performance returns, include the GUID or URI or so of the given XIO object, for clarification (return of Get-XIODataProtectionGroupPerformance for multi-cluster does not give distinguishable objects -- can't tell the cluster of each DPG)
-deprecate VolumeFolder, InitiatorGroupFolder cmdlets, and the use of these object types for RelatedObject param values in cmdlets
-need to exclude -OperatingSystem parameter option in New-XIOInitiator if API of XMS is v1 -- breaks things to send along in a request to API V1 XMS; lower priority
-for when dropping support for legacy XIOS/API (XIOS 2 & 3, API v1)
	-remove PerformanceInfo property from IGFolder, VolumeFolder (and remove Get-XIOInitiatorGroupFolderPerformance, Get-XIOVolumeFolderPerformance cmdlets)
	-remove the Nullable aspect of .Cluster properties in the type def (v2 API objects should always have the .sys-id property on objects for which code tries to make .Cluster value from said property)
-item types for which to add support in module:
	iscsi-portals
	iscsi-routes
-add ability to create ISCSI initiators via New-XIOInitiator
-add Set-XIOAlert once getting the proper JSON body info from either updated docs or from EMC ("command" is not valid, but is the only property specified in the API reference)
-update (refactor) to use either hshParamsForGetXioInfo or hshParamsForGetXioItemInfo variable name in the GetXIOItem.ps1
-?gracefully handle Entity-type / Tag-type mismatch in New-XIOTagAssignment?  Right now, user must assign proper Tag type to proper Entity type (cmdlet does not currently prevent user from trying to assign an Initiator tag to a Volume entity, for example)
-?if adding this project to that EMC {code} site, add things to ReadMe related to "EMC {code}" (see requirements/suggestions on EMC {code} site)
-?add something that handles return of objects such that only one instance of each unique object is returned?  For example:  should "Get-XIOInitiatorGroup | select -First 5 | Get-XIOSnapshot -Name mysnap044.*" only return one object for "mysnap044.lastweeksnap", even if that snapshot is mapped to all of the five InitiatorGroups passed as RelateObjects to Get-XIOSnapshot?  The, "return only unique objects" behavior is how some other modules do it, like PowerCLI, for example
-?add Tag as supported RelatedObject type on Get-XIO* cmdlets?  Tags do not have Cluster properties, so may give unexpected behavior if only getting targeted object by name (won't have associated Cluster by which to pinpoint the targeted object); or, need to use Guid instead and filter?  A: still hit the "need cluster name" issue for when in multi-cluster situation; need to solve this someway
-for future (once supporitng iSCSI in this PSModule), add ability to set following properties via Set-XIOInitiator:  'initiator-authentication-user-name', 'initiator-authentication-password', 'initiator-discovery-user-name', 'initiator-discovery-password', 'cluster-authentication-user-name', 'cluster-authentication-password', 'cluster-discovery-user-name', 'cluster-discovery-password', 'remove-initiator-authentication-credentials', 'remove-initiator-discovery-credentials', 'remove-cluster-authentication-credentials', 'remove-cluster-discovery-credentials'
-?add ability for Get-XIOItemInfo to detect, for when -URI paramset is used, that "full=1" is in use, and to handle return object creation accordingly
-?add ability to specify -Tag for when creating new objects that support "tag-list" property via API (like New-XIOInitiatorGroup, for example); or, just stick w/ adding new Tag assignments via dedicated cmdlet?  Answer:  the latter; user can add tag assignment via New-XIOTagAssignment along the New-XIO* object creation pipeline
-?for Set-XIO* cmdlets other than Set-XIOItemInfo, add ability to specify object by name and cluster?  Currently just supports by-object
-?for PerfomanceCounter objects, need better way to present the .Counters property? (for easier export by user once retrieved)
-?eventually for Open-XIOMgmtConsole:  only act on existing XMS connections (as the cmdlet will need the XMS software version in order to create the correct URL to the JNLP file); or, will this cmdlet change to open the web management console instead of the Java management console, once the Web UI takes over?
-?provide ability for module user to set preferences for the module?  Like, a different default value for -OperatingSystem for New-XIOInitiator, for example?
	-if so:
	-add a Get-XIOUtilsConfiguration function to report things like the filespec of the StoredXioCred
	-add a Set-XIOUtilsConfiguration function to set things like the default port to use, and $true/$false for TrustAllCert
-?add "if ($PsCmdlet.ShouldProcess())" portion to New-XIOVolume, around the New-XioItem call, so as to have better WhatIf output?
-?add "small" and "unaligned" performance items, too? (available in xmcli)
-?replace usage of singular item type string (essentially used for output type name creation; make config hsh table of plural item type string -> XIOItemInfo output object type)
	-use the config API item types as the ValidateSet value for ItemType in Get-XIOItem function, so as not to need to upkeep such info in multiple places!
	-have config hsh of API type (like /types/ig-folders) -> XioItemInfo type (like IgFolder)
		-to remove the "strip an 's', title case the string, and remove the dash" antics that are in place now
		-need to update all places that specify API types as singular to use real API type name
-?add object definitions of sub-property objects?  Could slow things down (like Get-VM does vs. Get-View in PowerCLI)
-?for when rev'ing minimum API support level to API v2.0, remove the conditional Cluster property population code (as needed .sys-id property should be present on everything at that point); affected object types:  Initiator, InitiatorGroup, LunMap, Target,
-?add Get-XIOAssignment cmdlet, and update Remove-XIOTagAssignment to take that from pipeline?  Could be an easier pipeline for the user for when removing Tag assignments


-known issues / considerations:
From module release v1.2.0

- User must assign proper Tag type to proper Entity type (cmdlet does not currently prevent user from trying to assign an Initiator tag to a Volume entity, for example)
- XIO REST API version support for specifying `-Name` for new SnapshotScheduler:  the XIO REST API v2.0 does not seem to support specifying the name for a new scheduler, but the REST API v2.1 (and newer, presumably) does support specifying the name.
- cannot get deprecated XIO VolumeFolder from Snapshot object in modern XIOS (with modern REST API), as API does not provide "folder" type of property any more. Support for Snapshot type as related object to `Get-XIOVolumeFolder` will be removed in future release (though, may survive until the altogether removal of `Get-XIOVolumeFolder`)
- `New-XIOTag`, `Set-XIOTag`: Specifying `-Color` parameter is only supported by the XIO REST API starting in v2.1 of said REST API

From module release v1.1.0

- In XtremIO REST API v2.0, getting objects from pipeline with `SnapshotScheduler` as the `-RelatedObject` in a multi-cluster XMS scenario may return more that just one of given object type:  the XIOS API does not have cluster-specificity for `SnapshotScheduler` objects, so objects related to `SnapshotScheduler` are retrieved only by name and XMS computer name for now (until better filtering based on GUID is in place); if objects of same name exist across mutliple clusters in this XMS, all of those objects will be returned.  This is not the case starting in XtremIO REST API v2.1.
- When connected to a multi-cluster XMS, getting the following objects in the given ways may fail with, "cluster\_id\_is\_required" message:
	- `Get-XIOVolume` when using a `VolumeFolder` as the `-RelatedObject` parameter value
	- `Get-XIOInitiatorGroup` when using an `IgFolder` as the `-RelatedObject` parameter value
	- This is due to `VolumeFolder` and `IgFolder` objects not having a `Cluster` property
	- this may not get resolved, as support for `VolumeFolder`/`IgFolder` objects is going away (they have been replaced with `Tag` objects)
- `Remove-XIOUserAccount` via the XIO API v2.1 (on at least XMS version 4.2.0-33) -- fails with message "Invalid property user-id" due to potentially changed API parameter (not confirmed, but events on XMS show param name as "usr_id", API ref until this point says "user-id", with the dash/underscore being insignificant, as they seem interchangable, but with the "usr" vs. user" difference possibly being the issue)
- `Remove-XIOInitiatorGroupFolder`, `Remove-VolumeFolder` via XIO API v2.1 (on at least XMS version 4.2.0-33) -- fails with message "Invalid property", which is "ig-folder-name" for `IgFolder` objects, "folder-type" for `VolumeFolder` objects; potentially due changed API in which folder support is now different/gone
	- folder support will be removed from this PowerShell module eventually, so these may not get addressed
	- Workaround:  these items show up as `Tag` objects, too, so one can use `Get-XIOTag` to get them, and `Remove-XIOTag` to remove them
- Specifying `-ParentFolder` parameter to `New-XIOVolume` via XIO API v2.1 (on at least XMS version 4.2.0-33) -- fails with message "Command Syntax Error: Invalid property ig-folder-name"; again, potentially due changed API in which folder support is now different/gone
	- Workaround:  do not specify `-ParentFolder` parameter, which creates volume without volume tag







should do next:
- add to Known Issues about filtering and that it is not cluster-specific (not implemented as such, and API does not seem to support it)
- fix typo "multple" in help for `Set-XIOLdapConfig`
- update ReadMe w/ some of the info on the module's GeneralInfo page at vN -- the PSGet stuff, the getting started stuff, etc.;
- add -Tag param to lots of Get-XIO* cmdlets (or include Tag type as accepted type by -RelatedObject param), and accept from pipeline
- update parameter names to be consistent across cmdlets (remove "_str" and "_arr" types of trailing parameter bits)
	- ?make aliases for now, but deprecate the longer, non-PowerShell-y param names?

done:
[feat_AddFilterSupport]
- add initial Filtering support, possible only in API v2+ (need to handle how to only "enable" it for XIOSv4+ XMSs)
	- see the "Filter" support that came in API v2 in the API guide (pp15-16 in EMC® XtremIO Storage Array Versions 4.0 and 4.0.1 RESTful API (Ver. 2.0) Guide)
	- good for speeding up LunMap retrieval and the likes
	- put into ByComputerName parameterset (should not be valid in SpecifyFullUri parameterset):
		- AdditionalURIParam, UseApiFullFeature, Property, Cluster parameters
	## notes/observations on getting items w/ filtering:
	- returned full-response object does not have "content" property on which the creation of new return object in XtremIO.Utils module is based
	- with &full=1:
		returned full-response object has three properties:  <item-type> (plural), params, and links; links seems to just be to base object type URL (no object index included in URL)
	- without &full=1:
		returned full-response object has just two properties:  <item-type> (plural) that has (href property:  the item-specific URL w/o cluster, name property:  name of the object) and links; links seems to just be to base object type URL (no object index included in URL)
[feat_ImproveGetXIOLunMap]
- improved `Get-XIOLunMap`:
	- revisited pipelining, since Filtering support is in place in `Get-XIOItemInfo`
	- added `-RelatedItem` parameter, which supports InitiatorGroup, Volume, and Snapshot items
	- added `-Name` param, for the off chance that someone wants to get LunMap by "1_3_1" kind of name (say, for once you've just gotten a LunMap in some other way, and want to quickly get just that one again)
